GroMon
======
Basic wireless monitoring platform for experimentation and rapid prototyping.

* Raspberry Pi
* Arduino
* Node.js
* Bluetooth

#Bill of Materials
===
This is "must have" list for building the GroMon system. Each "half" of the solution is broken out separately. You can absolutely build either half independently, allowing you to split the purchase in two but still keep hacking.

## Server-side
* [Raspberry Pi](http://adafruit.com/products/998)
* [SD card](http://adafruit.com/products/102)
* [Wifi dongle](http://adafruit.com/products/814)
* Bluetooth dongle

## Arduino-side
* [Bluetooth Bee Standalone](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/bluetooth-bee-standalone-p-1157.html?cPath=139_142)
* [Seeed Studio XBee Carrier](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-xbee-carrier-p-905.html?cPath=132_134)
* [DHT11 temperature sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-temphumi-sensor-p-745.html?cPath=144_147)
* [Grove cables](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/grove-universal-4-pin-20cm-unbuckled-cable-5-pcs-pack-p-749.html?cPath=178_179) for connecting the Seeed Studios gear 

## Stuff you probably have
But if not, you really should buy it.

* Micro USB cable
* Mini USB cable
* Some way of supplying power to the USB cables (like a wall wart, powered USB hub, etc)

## Optional fancy stuff
* [USB to TTL serial cable](http://www.adafruit.com/products/954) for the Raspberry Pi
